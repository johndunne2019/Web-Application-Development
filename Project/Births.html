	<h2 class="paragraphs"> I have included below a bar chart showing the number of calf births ('000s) registered in Ireland during 2019 where the sire of the calf was a beef breed. The numbers are available to view on the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine website at the following link: <a href="https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/animalhealthwelfare/animalidentificationmovement/cattle/bovinebirthandmovementsmonthlyreports/"target="_blank">Bovine Birth and Movements Monthly Reports</a>. There are also some other useful and interesting statistics at this link which I recommend for those interested in finding out more.
